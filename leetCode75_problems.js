1768. Merge Strings Alternately
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.



Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q
merged: a p b q c   d


Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

*/

var mergeAlternately = function (word1, word2) {
    let newStr = "";
    let flag = false;

    while (word1.length !== 0 && word2.length !== 0) {
        if (!flag) {
            newStr += word1.slice(0, 1);
            word1 = word1.slice(1);
        } else {
            newStr += word2.slice(0, 1);
            word2 = word2.slice(1);
        }

        flag = !flag;
    }

    if (word1.length === 0) newStr += word2;
    if (word2.length === 0) newStr += word1;

    return newStr;
};

1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.



Example 1:

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"
Example 2:

Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
Output: "AB"
Example 3:

Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: ""


Constraints:

1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.
*/

const gcdOfStrings = (str1, str2) => {
    const gcd = (a, b) => {
        return b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    };

    if (str1 + str2 !== str2 + str1) return "";

    return str1.substring(0, gcd(str1.length, str2.length));
};

1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.



Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
Example 2:

Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.
Example 3:

Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]


Constraints:

n == candies.length
2 <= n <= 100
1 <= candies[i] <= 100
1 <= extraCandies <= 50
*/

var kidsWithCandies = function (candies, extraCandies) {
    const maxCandy = Math.max(...candies);

    const results = candies.map((candy) => candy + extraCandies >= maxCandy);

    return results;
};
